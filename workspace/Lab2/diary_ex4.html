			<h2>Winnie-the-Pooh by <span>A. A. Milne</span></h2>
			
			<p>
				In the Milne books, Pooh is naive and slow-witted, but he is also friendly, thoughtful and steadfast. Although he and his friends agree that he is "a bear of very little brain," Pooh is occasionally acknowledged to have a clever idea, usually driven by common sense.

			<h2>The Handmaid's Tale by <span>Margaret Atwood</span></h2>
		
			<p>
				After a staged attack that killed the President of the United States and most of Congress, a radical political group called the "Sons of Jacob" used quasi-Christian ideology to launch a revolution. The United States Constitution was suspended, newspapers were censored, and what was formerly the United States of America was changed into a military dictatorship known as the Republic of Gilead.
